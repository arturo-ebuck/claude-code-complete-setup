# Advanced MCP Tools Usage Guide

## Overview of Your Advanced MCP Setup

You now have three powerful MCP tools that work together to enhance Claude's capabilities:

### 1. **Sequential-Thinking MCP** (✅ Active)
- **Purpose**: Structured problem-solving through defined cognitive stages
- **Replaces**: Basic memory MCP (you're right - no longer needed!)
- **Autonomous Usage**: I'll automatically use this for complex problems

### 2. **SuperClaude Framework** (✅ Installed)
- **Purpose**: Adds 16 specialized commands and smart personas
- **Commands**: Use `/sc:` prefix (e.g., `/sc:implement`, `/sc:analyze`)
- **Autonomous Usage**: Personas activate automatically based on context

### 3. **Graphiti** (⚠️ Needs Setup)
- **Purpose**: Knowledge graph system for persistent memory
- **Status**: Documented but not in active config
- **Next Step**: Need to install and configure if you want to use it

## How These Tools Work Together

### Automatic Context Management
**Sequential-Thinking** automatically engages when I detect:
- Multi-step problems
- Complex analysis tasks
- Decision-making scenarios
- Research and synthesis needs

**Example Flow**:
```
You: "Help me design a new authentication system"
Me: [Automatically uses Sequential-Thinking]
    1. Problem Definition: Understanding requirements
    2. Research: Checking existing patterns
    3. Analysis: Evaluating options
    4. Synthesis: Combining best practices
    5. Conclusion: Final recommendation
```

### SuperClaude Commands You Can Use

**Most Useful Commands**:
- `/sc:implement <feature>` - Build new features
- `/sc:analyze <code/system>` - Deep analysis
- `/sc:troubleshoot <issue>` - Debug problems
- `/sc:design <system>` - Architecture design
- `/sc:improve <code>` - Optimize existing code

**Autonomous Activation**: Even without commands, SuperClaude personas activate:
- **architect** - System design discussions
- **security** - Security concerns
- **analyzer** - Debugging sessions
- **frontend/backend** - Specific domain work

## Practical Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complex Feature Implementation
```
You: "I need to add user authentication with OAuth"

What happens automatically:
1. Sequential-Thinking activates for planning
2. SuperClaude's architect persona engages
3. I break down the task systematically
4. Implement with security best practices
```

### Example 2: Debugging Session
```
You: "My API is returning 500 errors intermittently"

What happens automatically:
1. analyzer persona activates
2. Sequential-Thinking structures the investigation
3. Systematic troubleshooting approach
4. Root cause analysis and fix
```

### Example 3: Code Review
```
You: "/sc:analyze my authentication module"

What happens:
1. Explicit command triggers deep analysis
2. Security persona may also engage
3. Comprehensive review with suggestions
```

## Memory Management Without Old Memory MCP

You're correct - with these advanced tools, the basic memory MCP is redundant:

**Sequential-Thinking** provides:
- Session-based thought tracking
- Progress monitoring
- Relationship analysis between thoughts

**Graphiti** (when configured) would provide:
- Persistent knowledge graphs
- Cross-session memory
- Semantic search capabilities

**SuperClaude** provides:
- Context-aware responses
- Domain-specific expertise
- Task management

## Optimizing Tool Usage

### 1. **Let Automation Work**
- Don't specify tools manually unless needed
- I'll choose the right approach automatically
- Trust the persona system to engage experts

### 2. **Use Commands for Specific Tasks**
- `/sc:implement` for new features
- `/sc:analyze` for code reviews
- `/sc:troubleshoot` for debugging
- `/sc:design` for architecture

### 3. **Complex Problems**
- Just describe your problem naturally
- Sequential-Thinking will structure approach
- Personas will provide expertise
- You'll see the systematic breakdown

### 4. **Session Management**
- Each Sequential-Thinking session is independent
- Use `generate_summary` to review progress
- Use `clear_history` to start fresh

## What You Don't Need to Remember

**Automatic Behaviors**:
- Problem structuring (Sequential-Thinking)
- Expert selection (SuperClaude personas)
- Best practices application
- Security considerations
- Code style matching

**Manual Commands** (only when needed):
- SuperClaude: `/sc:` commands
- Sequential-Thinking: Handled automatically
- File operations: Just describe what you need

## Next Steps

### To Enable Graphiti:
```bash
# 1. Install graphiti
cd /home/jb_remus/claude-code-desktop02-setup/mcp-servers/
git clone https://github.com/Paul-Allen-AI/graphiti.git
cd graphiti
uv sync

# 2. Start Neo4j
docker run -d --name graphiti-neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
  neo4j:latest

# 3. Add to MCP config
# (I can help with this when ready)
```

## Summary

Your setup provides:
- **Structured thinking** without manual memory management
- **Expert assistance** through automatic persona activation
- **Specialized commands** when you need explicit control
- **No redundancy** - each tool serves a unique purpose

The key is: **describe what you need, and I'll handle the complexity** using these tools autonomously.
