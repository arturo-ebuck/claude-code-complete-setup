# Memory Review Fix - August 4, 2025

## Issue
After consolidating 24 memory files into 4 master files, the "review memory" command stopped working because CLAUDE.md was overwritten with only SuperClaude framework references.

## Solution
Updated `/home/jb_remus/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to include both:
1. Personal memory files (4 consolidated files)
2. SuperClaude framework files

## Structure
```
CLAUDE.md
├── Personal Memory Files
│   ├── SYSTEM-STATUS-AND-SETUP.md
│   ├── CRITICAL-RULES-AND-PREFERENCES.md
│   ├── WORKFLOWS-AND-PATTERNS.md
│   └── TOOLS-AND-REFERENCE.md
└── SuperClaude Framework
    ├── COMMANDS.md
    ├── FLAGS.md
    ├── PRINCIPLES.md
    ├── RULES.md
    ├── MCP.md
    ├── PERSONAS.md
    ├── ORCHESTRATOR.md
    └── MODES.md
```

## Result
"Review memory" command now works properly by loading:
- Your 4 consolidated personal memory files
- SuperClaude framework enhancements

Both systems work together seamlessly!
